This is a simulation of the famous Monty Hall Problem

**A few notes about configuring the code for your own simulations:**

>'pause' is used to add some delay to the calculations so you can see the simulations as they are run *(.00125 is the default)*

>'num_games' is the number of simulations run for both cases of switching the doors or not switching the doors *('1000' is the default, meaning 2000 total simulations are run)*
